                TIME DILATION
              </span>
              <p>In simple terms time dilation means moving clocks run slow. Actually the frame in which the two events occur at
                 same position is proper time frame and the time elapsed between those events is proper time. And in any other
                 moving inertial frame this time interval gets dilated.

                LENGTH CONTRACTION
              </span>
              <p>Proper length frame is the frame in which the object is at rest. In moving frames the length along the direction
                 of motion gets contracted. However the length along the direction perpendicular to the motion is not affected
                 at all.

                SIMULTANEITY OF RELATIVITY
              </span>
              <p>Two events which are simultaneous in one frame need not be simultaneous in other moving frame. The order and
                 causality of events depend whether the events are time-like separated or space-like separated or light-like
                 separated.
